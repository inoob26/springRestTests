Test SpringBoot + Hibernate + jQuery + Bootstrap

![stack Overflow](https://github.com/inoob26/springRestTests/blob/master/public/Screen%20Shot.png?raw=true)

In this project i worked with SpringBoot and Hibernate.

Also i had MySQL table Employee with columns:
ID , Name, Position

Java code returned data as JSON format and i read JSON data using jQuery.

I implemented add, edit and delete methods.
